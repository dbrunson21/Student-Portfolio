## Description

This is my personal Student Portfolio designed to help me throughout the duration of the UCF Bootcamp and into my career as a developer!
This website was built to showcase my work within the course  and made so that I can add to it later.
I've learned much particularly portaining to CSS and styling specific elements using newly learned flex properties
