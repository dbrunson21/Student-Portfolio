            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="right-column">
                <p> I grew up in Denver, Colorado where my lifelong passion for music has been a driving force. I've
                    always yearned for a career that would allow me to harness the same creative faculties that music
                    affords. Interestingly, I discovered a fascination for full-stack web development, as it, much
                    like music, serves as a medium to convey one's thoughts and ideas to the world. Presently, I'm
                    dedicated to my education in the University of Centeral Florida's coding bootcamp, set to proudly
                    earn my full stack web
                    development certificate in January 2024. I'm also working full
                    time as an Information Technology Helpdesk Analyst for Rotech Healthcare. Beyond my professional
                    life, I find joy in hobbies such as music production, video gaming, and culinary exploration. Additionally, I am an
                    active volunteer at Illuminate Church in Celebration, Florida, where I passionately play the bass
                    guitar and contribute to the youth and young adult ministries.</p>
