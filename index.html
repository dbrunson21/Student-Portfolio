            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="right-column">
                <p> I grew up in Denver, Colorado. I've always had a passion for music and wanted to choose a career
                    that allowed me to use the same creative parts of my brain. I inevitably grew an interest for full
                    stack web development because, like music, it is a language you can use to express yourself and
                    share new ideas with others. I'm currently enrolled in the UCF coding bootcamp and will graduate
                    with a certificate for full stack web development in January of 2024. I'm also working full
                    time as an Information Technology Helpdesk Analyst for Rotech Healthcare. A couple hobbies of mine
                    include playing video games and cooking. I also volunteer at my local church called Illuminate
                    Church in Celebration Florida, playing bass guitar and serving in the youth and young adult
                    ministries.</p>
